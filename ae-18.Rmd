```


```{r mean-distrators}

  summarize(mean_per_distractor = mean(Time))
```
As distractors increase, mean reaction time increases until 16...

```{r rt-by-distractors}
recognition %>%
 filter(Emotion == "Happy" | Emotion == "Sad") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Distractors, y = Time, 
                                           color = Emotion)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Reaction Time by Number of Distractors", 
       subtitle = "All Subjects", y = "Reaction time in Seconds")
```

```{r}
recognition %>%
  ggplot(data = recognition, mapping = aes(x = Distractors, y = Time, 
                                           color = Emotion)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~ Participant)
  labs(title = "Reaction Time by Number of Distractors", 
       subtitle = "All Subjects", y = "Reaction time in Seconds")
```

```{r average-happy-vs-sad-rt}
recognition %>%
  group_by(Emotion) %>%
  summarize(mean_per_distractor = mean(Time))
```
The average RT of Happy was 1.81 seconds while Sad was 1.89 seconds, very very
similar. 

```{r average-happy-vs-sad-rt-by-distraction-level}
happy <- recognition %>%
  filter("Emotion") %>%
##how do get average reaction time for Happy at certain levels vs sad at certain levels?
  
```

```{r}
mean_time_by_emotion_distractor_person <- recognition %>%
  group_by(Emotion, Distractors, Person) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Time))
```
